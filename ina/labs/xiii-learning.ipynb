    "In the following exercises, you will evaluate node classification and link prediction using either node or edge features or their embeddings. For this, you can use a machine learning library such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) that contains implementations of popular classifiers. Another way is to generate a tab-separated file for each exercise with nodes or edges in rows and features or embeddings in columns, and upload the file to the [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com) data mining software."
